# WSL2 Ubuntu Base System Playbook

This is pretty much a pared down version of my [ansible.ubuntu](https://github.com/code-chimp/ansible.ubuntu)
repository. All of the tasks are tested in that project and then brought here.

## Set up/access WSL Ubuntu instance and run playbook

Thanks to my friend Bhuvan, I can let PowerShell do the heavy lifting:

```sh
.\setup.ps1
```
